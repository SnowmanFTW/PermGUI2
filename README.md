# Why is PermGUI 2 open-source?
I feel much better about how my code looks in general, and now that it is open-source, YOU can contribute (see below) to PermGUI 2's code and fix bugs that I may not have spotted so you can make PermGUI 2 a better plugin!

# Contributing
If you would like to contribute to PermGUI 2 to fix a bug you spotted or to add a new feature, go to the code you want to fix/change, hit the Edit button and do what ever you need to do. When pressing Propose Changes, you will be brung to a Pull Request page, which then it'll make a request for me to then accept or decline.

**If you are editing code, please make sure to keep the code structure clean. Messy code or unwanted features will be declined!**

If you have contributed any plugins, you can join the Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/GJj6Uk8YS6) and get a special Contributor role.

# Branches
Until the plugin is finished, everything that is commited will be pushed to this branch.
